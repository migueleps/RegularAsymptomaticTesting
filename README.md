# Regular Asymptomatic Testing for COVID-19
Repository with the code used to run experiments for the paper "The role of regular asymptomatic testing in reducing the impact of a COVID-19 wave"

# Environment installation

The minimum set of packages needed to run the experiements is in _requirements.yml_. To create a conda environment using this file, run the command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Change the first line of _requirements.yml_ to change the name of the resulting conda environment (default is tti_network).
